# M1ConfigGenerator
This project is intended to be an easier way to configure our M1 cards than the specialized Excel sheets.

The Quick setup mode only allows certain parameters to be configurable and then provides default values for the parameters that don't need to change for 95%+ of projects.

The Full setup mode allows access to every parameter on a card in the event that we have to use an uncommon configuration.
